         Using login.txt to check account.(Need improve, sometime may have bugs)
         Keep-alive connection
         Using telnet to connect
         Using 'ping/pong' to check bot connection status(use 'scan' to check it by yourself or it checks every 15 seconds.)

Opinion:
    In my opinion, best way is using python v3.4.3 and pyinstaller v3.2. They are the best pattern i tested and used.

Usage:
    Change the cnc server ip and port into the client.py at first.

Then, edit the password of cnc.py and run the cnc.py:

python3 cnc.py <port>
At Last, run the bot.py in any python3 environment(IDE, codeanywhere,etc.) or u can use pyinstaller to help u

then the Bot is online.

To login cnc, using telnet(Updated after v2) connect it then

It should be show like this:

    Username:
At this moment, u should create a file called login.txt and input the username and password in it

Like this:

    error1 test
After that, Just input ur username and password.

        Username:error123
        Password:test
